(UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

Getting my feet wet with react since that's what all the cool kids are doing now. 

Goal: Truth Table Generator: enter a proposition and click submit (truthify it!!) to generate a table that displays the truth-value of a compound statement for every truth-value of its component statements 

TODO: 
* refactor truthify logic to deal with more complex propositions
* add comments
* style
* refactor Board logic to return more data to table
